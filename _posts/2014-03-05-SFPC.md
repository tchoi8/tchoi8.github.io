**Teachers:** Zach, Taeyoon, Jonathan Dahan (full time), + more part time and full time teachers 

*check regarding Amit's availability during this time.*
 
*Ramsey Nasser and few others are interested in teaching. I'm also talking with Molmol about doing part time, or artist in residence at sfpc* 

**Artist in residence:** Ishac Bertran, Jonathan Wohl, Tega Brain (sfpc alumni), tbd 

Administration: Casey(admin), Moises (documentation)

**Program goal** 

* Intensive time and space to fully dedicate in experiment with computational medium.
* Not a technical bootcamp or media art incubator.  
* Teachers and artist in residence will provide technical, conceptual and artistic guide to make ideal learning environment. 
* Collaboration is highly encouraged. Infact, the program is designed to make free cooperation possible in teaching and learning as well as making new work.  
* An experimental platform to develop into full ten weeks program in the fall. 
* Invitation for a nurturing community of hackers and artists in New York and beyond through our alumni mailing list, guest lecture and public presentation.

Space 
--- 

Former Kickstarter HQ

* Easy access
* great vibe 
* pricy $3500+ / two weeks 
* Will be great except higher rent will mean higher tuition cost. 


Enchanted palace (Moises and Alyssa's loft)

* doorman building, students can access, visitors may need to be signed in
* great vibe
* basically a lofty living room of high end apartment building in West Village 
* Easy access via subway and etc 
* reasonabl price $1500+/ two weeks + cleaning service and etc 

NYU Poly MAGNET

* might not be availiable until summer break
* easy access 
* great technical facility
* not artistic vibe, but functional


IFP film center 

* not easy access (Dumbo F train/ 10 minutes walk)
* not ideal learning environment (noise, light issues)
* reasonable price $1800+/ two weeks 
* the classrooms are encolsed in glass, and sound leaks from outside as well as inside ventilation. 
* flex space: low ceiling, adjacent to cafe: noise, smell issues
* other suspicions about working with them: we had false promise last year, and the situation in IFP doesn't sound secure.  


Tuition and cost
---

*Tuition cost will vary upon rent and teacher's payment and administration cost.* 

Ideally it will be $1000/ student to keep as same rate as 10 weeks program. This may be unrealistic with administrative cost involved in shorter session is significant and rent may be higher during two weeks. I was hoping to shoot for 1500/ student, but it may be somewhere between 1500 and  2000/ student if we pay $4000 for rent (Kickstarter space rent + etc including storage) 

I think it's very important to keep the students number lower, and higher number of teachers/ artist in residence. so 12 students + 4 full time faculty + 5~6 part time/ artist in residence will be great.


* Full time teachers payment for two weeks $3000 (5 days/ week - 10 days: $300/day - this looks high, but this includes class preparation time and some material for the class) * 4 people 
* Visiting artist stripend $1000 (4 artists over two weeks )
* Guest lecture $200(5 artists: $1000) 
* Administration (2~3 people over 1 month. $25 * 160 hours =$4000)
* Rent $4000 (max, including storage fee for dormant months and moving fee. this can be as low as $2000)

**Sum 25000 + other unseen cost and tax**  

* for 12 students $2083 
* for 15 students $1666
