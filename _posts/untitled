Yesterday I stood in front of a couple hundred people and said that my pronoun is she; my adjective is blind. Before moving on with my speech, I explained that I identify as blind because the word is affirming and doesn't contain room for absence. Instead, it's a way of experiencing the world that, for me, emphasizes things like language, movement, sound and touch. I was inspired to try this intro by my new work experience trainee, who is convinced that "person with visual impairment" is the only correct way to write about one of us. I feel a little trepidatious about connecting to the important work of getting people to recognize preferred pronouns but I hope it's OK: blindness is the part of my identity and embodiment that people question, the word they refuse to use. I'm also a little worried about this intro because of course I have other adjectives and blindness doesn't define me; but, again, this is the one that people, even close allies, consistently avoid even though it's important to me. Yesterday and today I received quite a few Twitter mentions and, for the first time I can think of after a public event, everybody referred to me as blind. I support each person's decision to identify as visually impaired, low vision, or something else. I don't think my choice necessarily fits everyone, but it's the best one for me. It's been absolutely wonderful to enjoy a day of new acquaintances and complete strangers hearing, accepting and mirroring the language I use to describe the way I perceive and move in the world.
