<h1 class="title">To Remember and Forget - Memory and Machine</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p><em>This is a class proposal for <a href='http://itp.nyu.edu/sigs/program/'>NYU ITP</a> in Fall of 2014.</em></p>

<h1 id="to_remember_and_forget_memory_and_machine">To Remember and Forget: Memory and Machine</h1>

<p>What happens in our brain when we remember and when we forget? How is our sense of memory transforming with computational technology in daily life? How do we rely on the mobile devices to assist memory and store in permanent storage? By asking these questions, we begin to understand various factors that are mediating sense of presence and memory.</p>

<p>Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux explains plasticity of synapses in our brain is the core mechanism that enable human sense of self. Thus we know that we exist by remembering things past and anticipating things to come. Revolutionary developments occurred simultaneously in computer science and neuroscience since the 1960s. Neuroscience had less apparent effect in the realm of art and culture, while popular recognition of Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence continues to inspire notions of thinking and feeling machines.</p>

<p>This class will explore the connection between neural plasticity and computation in social and aesthetic context. Each class will begin with a lecture on memory and technical inventions through history of disciplines and work of art and literature. Lecturer will also demonstrate related technology such as logic gate level electronics to help understand fundamental of digital computation to varieties of clinical and archival software. In class activity will include group discussion and student presentation. Over seven weeks period, students will create two interactive art work in response to the topics of human memory and technical objects, first one will be a system to help them remember and the second one will be a device to help them forget. Students are expected to bring in their skills in programming and physical computing to realize their projects.</p>

<p>7 week syllabus</p>

<p><strong>Week 1 Memory and storage</strong></p>

<p>How is memory shaped by technical reproduction and visual representation? Why is archive important and how can it be reanimated?</p>

<ul>
<li>Catherine Malabou, What Should We Do With Our Brain? (New York: Fordham University Press, 2009, trans. Sebastian Rand)</li>

<li>Susan Buck-Morss, Dreamworld and Catastrophe: The Passing of Mass Utopia in East and West (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000) Jacques Derrida, Archive desire: A Freudian Impression (University of Chicago Press,1998) Student output: Read Jacques Derrida’s Notes upon the Mystic Writing Pad and write 500 words or longer reflection on the class blog.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Week 2 Neural plasticity</strong></p>

<p>What is the memory mechanisms in neurons? What is working memory and why is attention so important?</p>

<ul>
<li>Joseph LeDoux, Synaptic self: How are brains become who we are (London: Penguin Books, 2002)</li>
</ul>

<p>Student output: Students will present their ideas for a system to help them remember an event or specific memory. The project may take any form as long as it has an aspect of computation and participation.</p>

<p><strong>Week 3 Affect</strong></p>

<p>How do we fall in love? What is the difference between romantic love and euphoric states? What is the difference between emotions, feelings and affects? What now, if machines can feel? Artists have taken these question as an aesthetic exploration. For example, Melanie Gilligan’s video art that question the boundary between affects and currency, and Brody Condon’s participatory performance that reverse participation and spectatorship through game mechanics.</p>

<ul>
<li>Andreas Bartels and Semir Zeki, The neural basis of romantic love (NeuroReport 11:3829- 3834)</li>

<li>Melanie Gilligan, Affects and Exchange (Fillip, Intangible economies, 2011)</li>
</ul>

<p>Student output: Students will present their first assignment. Their project may be presented in forms of video documentation and live performance.</p>

<p><strong>Week 4 Taste</strong></p>

<p>For Proust, eating madeleine with tea brought back certain memory. In our daily activities related to taste, such as cooking, smelling and eating, we are reminded of past memory as we create new memory. What’s happening now that the artificial flavoring industry have mastered engineering of taste as instigator of memory? Artists such as Conflict Kitchen, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Jonathan Cohrs use taste as the medium for social and aesthetic confrontation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Julie Berger Hochstrasser, Still Life and Trade in the Dutch Golden Age (Yale University Press, 2007)</li>

<li>Walter Benjamin, Berlin Childhood around 1900 (Belknap Press, 2006)</li>
</ul>

<p>Student output: The class will have a picnic and students will tell a story about the memories related to the food they prepared.</p>

<p><strong>Week 5 Presence</strong></p>

<p>What makes human presence different from animal or object? How do we feel comfort or fear in presence of another person? What kind of change happens in our consciousness in crowd and in solitude?</p>

<ul>
<li>Alva Noë, Varieties of presence (Harvard University Press, 2012)</li>
</ul>

<p>Student output: Students will present their ideas for device to help forget an event or a specific memory.</p>

<p><strong>Week 6 Cybernetics</strong></p>

<p>How did the history of few disciplines; Cognitive Science, Human Compute Interaction and Art and Technology circa 1960’s appropriated and sometimes misused concepts of signal, feedback and entropy?</p>

<ul>
<li>Norbert Wiener, The Human Use of Human Beings, (Da Capo Press, March 22, 1988)</li>

<li>Bernard Stiegler, Technics and Time, 3: Cinematic Time and the Question of Malaise (Standford University Press, 2010)</li>
</ul>

<p>Student output: Students will break into groups of three and help each other brainstorm possible use scenario for their device to help forget.</p>

<p><strong>Week 7 Technical objects</strong></p>

<p>What is Gilbert Simondon’s concept of tools and instruments? And why is his thoughts on technical objects, automation and open machine relevant now?</p>

<ul>
<li>Gilbert Simondon, Du mode d’existence des objets techniques (Méot, 1958; second ed. Paris: Aubier, 1989). - English translation provided by the lecturer</li>
</ul>

<p>Student output: Student presentation of device to help forget an event or specific memory.</p>

<p>Reflection on the course and final discussion.</p>
