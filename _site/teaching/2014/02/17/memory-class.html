<h1 class="title">To remember and forget</h1>

<div id="post">
  <p><em>This is a work in progress proposal for a series of lecture and workshop. The series will be ideally hosted at a higher level academic institution or art space in collaboration with research labs. This series is an attempt to explore how human brain works in relation to computational technology.</em></p>

<p><strong>How can we learn to remember and how can we learn to forget?</strong></p>

<p>Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux explains plasticity of synapses in our brain is the core mechanism that enables human sense of self. Thus we know that we exist by remembering things past and anticipating things to come.</p>

<p>How is our sense of self transforming in presence of computational technology in daily life? And specifically, what role does mobile devices play in our communication with past and present? By finding answers to these questions, we can begin to understand integration among mediation of experience, construction of memory, archival desire and permanence of storage.</p>

<p>Revolutionary developments occurred simultaneously in computer science and neuroscience since the 60s. However, neuroscience seem to have had less greater effect in the realm of art and culture, while the popular recognition of Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence continues to inspire the notion of thinking and feeling machines. We will examine the history of art and computation as a sustained pursuit to understand human nature.</p>

<p>The series aims to be an opportunity to engage in critical thinking on technical topics ranging from neuroscience, analog computers to object oriented programming in its social context. For example, dominant paradigm of cybernetics in post war United States in relation to abstraction in visual art. Towards the second half of the series, participants will be encouraged to make new work (research or art work) inspired by technical and theoretical possibility of recently gained understanding in human brain and computation.</p>
<hr />
<p>This series starts by imagining what happens in our brain when we remember and when we forget. And how do we work for this to happen?</p>

<p>Human labor of remembering and the machine assisted memory by contemplating on the mediation of experience, archivial desire, and materiality of permanent storage.</p>

<p>The comparison between brain and computers, for example, voltage is applied to synapses during brain activity as well as electrical circuits during computation, have limitation and comes to a halt as we understand more about brain and it’s its plasticity.</p>

<p>The class will develop around text of following authors. The lecturer will deliver introduction to the text each class, students are expected to participate in discussion.The class will also host guest lecture by neuroscientist and archivist, class trip to libraries and museums.</p>
