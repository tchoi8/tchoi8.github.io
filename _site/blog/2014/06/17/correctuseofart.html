  <p>Correct use of art </p>

<p>&lt;img src=https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2897/14448531125_fb5355efd1_b.jpg&gt;</p>

<p>For a while I thought there is a clear distinction between things I do as an artist and things I do to support myself.  What I considered as art practice include traditional medium of drawing and writing, making objects (involving technology or not) and exhibiting and performing in gallery and art festivals. Doing things to get by included writing, researching,  coordinating, teaching and curating,  which are related to my art practice.  And there is the third kind of activity that I am interested that are neither art or job, which is activism and social change. </p>

<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3923/14261916900_d6f37048cc_b.jpg" /></p>

<p>I used to think binary between art as something I want to do and everything else as something the world needs from me.  It got confusing once I started to question social value of art and job I was doing. After few achievements as well as oversights, I’m realizing that the two are not completely separate and maybe some combinations the two can lead to realizations of ideas that are seemingly impossible on its own.</p>

<p>Granted that the role of art does not have to be completely aesthetic or utilitarian, It can be provocation and solution at the same time. I am fascinated by projects like these. </p>

<p><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2938/14448532095_0d13fc2231_b.jpg" /></p>

<p>The only constant in the above paragraph is ‘social’ and everything else are variables. </p>

<p>When art becomes tools and practices, it can become a vehicle for social change, empowerment and criticism. The term ‘social good’ is naively positive and ‘social change’ shadows thinking of humanity as linear evolution. but it is also a challenge to find a word that will represent shared interest of the artist as well as the participants (traditionally speaking, viewers) toward inventive use of art.  </p>

<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3880/14262090737_74f79a16a0_b.jpg" /></p>

<p>If  taken out of proper contextualization, empowerment can sometimes be easily confused with entitlement.  Art as empowerment can be mislead to privileging the ones who are already privileged, or worsen the disparity and antagonism.  Access to tools and space that are a momentary fix do not lead to sustained environment for creativity. </p>

<p><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3914/14447172312_4aef9dea48_b.jpg" /></p>

<p>What kind of social missions can we achieve with art? other than applying social missions as trends or style. </p>

<p><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2902/14447408074_74f79a16a0_b.jpg" /></p>

<p>The easy answer to initial question is simply, there is not correct use of art.  If art can be used for our private and shared interest, there are some other questions I would like to keep thinking as I proceed with new body of work. </p>

<p>How can an artist make social change through an art project on their own? What are the ways for a small scale project with little budget to make meaningful impact. How can art spaces: museums, galleries and studios operate as a space to support social change? </p>
